# Patent IN24/2404 202441091887 Project Medisure : Device & Method for Monitoring Blood Parameters of a User
## 🌍 Welcome to Project Medisure! 
### 💡 Prior Art
This initiative reflects our commitment to contributing meaningfully to the healthcare industry.
Over the past decade, non-invasive health monitoring has seen remarkable technological advancements, with numerous devices developed to improve patient comfort, usability, and the accuracy of health data. However, many existing solutions continue to face challenges, particularly in terms of long-term usability, patient compliance, and comprehensive health monitoring.
The proposed Medisure Care Plus device builds upon these existing systems, offering an innovative solution designed to overcome the shortcomings of current non-invasive monitoring technologies.

### 🛠️ Key Features  
- **Non-Invasive Multi-Parameter Monitoring** – Glucose, SpO₂, and pulse rate in one compact device  
- **Cost-Effective** – Minimal maintenance, no frequent strip/sensor replacements  
- **Portable & User-Friendly** – Finger-wearable design with integrated Wired Connection with mobile device for monitoring blood parameters 
- **Continuous Real-Time Data** – Accurate insights enabling early intervention  
- **Data Security** – Encrypted storage and secure communication protocols  
- **Healthcare Integration** – Seamless data sharing with healthcare providers  

### ⚙️ Hardware Components  
- **Arduino Nano and PCB board**: It is the foundation of the Device in which all the components are connected. Arduino IDE is the Software used to integrate the Hardware with the Software.
- **MAX30100 Sensor** :This sensor is used in order to measure the SPO2 levels and the pulse levels of the user. It combines two LED’s, a photodetector, optimized optics and low-analog signals to measure pulse and SPO2 levels. It measures by measuring the absorbance of pulsing blood through a photodetector. 
- **INA219 Current Sensor** : This is the current sensing module used in the Project and it is used in order to sense current and voltage inside the device .This module also helps in the I2C communication protocol used in the device.   
- **Glucose Strip & Sensor** : This sensor is used to measure the glucose level of the user. It consists of a strip in which the blood sample of the patient will be inserted. The strip has chemical enzymes which react with the blood which the sensor catches. Based on this reading and with the help of the current sensor, the glucose reading is found.
